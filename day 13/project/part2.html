    <p><strong>Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. ("Huawei" sometimes stylized as "HUAWEI" HWAH-way; Chinese: Âçé‰∏∫; pinyin:
            Hu√°w√©i‚ìò) is a Chinese multinational corporation and technology company headquartered in Longgang, Shenzhen,
            Guangdong. Its main product lines include telecommunications equipment, consumer electronics, electric
            vehicle autonomous driving systems, and rooftop solar power products. The company was founded in Shenzhen in
            1987 by Ren Zhengfei, a veteran officer of the People's Liberation Army (PLA).[5] Initially focused on
            manufacturing phone switches, Huawei has expanded to more than 170 countries to include building
            telecommunications network infrastructures, providing equipment, operational and consulting services, and
            manufacturing communications devices for the consumer market.[6] It overtook Ericsson in 2012 as the largest
            telecommunications equipment manufacturer in the world.[7] Huawei surpassed Apple and Samsung, in 2018 and
            2020, respectively, to become the largest smartphone manufacturer worldwide.[8][9] As of 2024, Huawei's
            biggest area of business is in telecommunications equipment. Its largest customer is the Chinese

    <p><strong>2013‚Äì2014: Founding and OnePlus One OnePlus Technology (Shenzhen) Co., Ltd. was founded on 16 December
            2013 by former Oppo vice-president Pete Lau and Carl Pei.[8] According to Chinese public records, OnePlus'
            only institutional Investor is Oppo Electronics.[4] Lau denied that OnePlus was a Subsidiary of Oppo and
            stated that Oppo Electronics and not Oppo Mobile (the phone manufacturer) is a major investor of OnePlus.
            Lau went on to state that they were "in talks with other investors",[9] although OnePlus has confirmed it
            uses Oppo's manufacturing line and shares part of the supply chain resources with Oppo. The OnePlus One was
            introduced on 23 April 2014 as OnePlus' first smartphone. It differed from its competitors‚Äîlargely flagship
            devices from larger phone manufacturers, in its usage of CyanogenOS, its openness to developers, and its
            price-to-performance ratio in comparison to its hardware, although criticism was levied for technical
            issues. In order to reduce marketing costs, OnePlus relied instead on word of mouth and initially only
            allowed purchases via an invite system.[11] Throughout early 2014, OnePlus would continue to expand, hiring
            Chinese celebrity author Han Han to help market its products in mainland China and expanding its operations
            to the European Union in March of that year.[17][18] In December 2014, alongside the release of the OnePlus
            One in India exclusively through Amazon, OnePlus also announced plans to establish a presence in the
            country, with plans to open 25 official walk-in service centers across India.</strong></p>
