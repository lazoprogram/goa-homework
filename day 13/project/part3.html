    <p><strong>Xiaomi is a Chinese multinational corporation and technology company
            headquartered in Beijing, China. It is best known for its consumer electronics, software, and electric
            vehicles. It is the second-largest manufacturer of smartphones in the world, behind Samsung,[4] most of
            which run on the Xiaomi HyperOS (former MIUI) operating system. The company is ranked 338th and is the
            youngest company on the Fortune Global 500.[5][6] It has been called the "Apple of China".[7]Xiaomi was
            founded in 2010 in Beijing by Lei Jun along with six associates. Lei had worked at Kingsoft as an executive
            and been involved in the founding and management of Joyo.com, the latter of which was sold to Amazon for $75
            million in 2004. In August 2011, Xiaomi released its first smartphone and by 2014 it had the largest market
            share of smartphones sold in China. Initially the company only sold its products online; however, it later
            opened brick and mortar stores.[8] By 2015, it was developing a wide range of consumer electronics.[9] In
            2020, the company sold 149.4 million smartphones and its MIUI (now Xiaomi HyperOS) mobile operating system
            has over 500 million monthly active users.[10] As of August 2024, Xiaomi is the second-largest seller of

            its own range of wearable items.[12] It also is a major manufacturer of appliances including televisions,
            flashlights, unmanned aerial vehicles, and air purifiers using its Internet of things and Xiaomi Smart Home
            product ecosystems.

    <p><strong>Nokia Corporation[5][a] is a Finnish multinational telecommunications, information technology, and
            consumer electronics corporation, originally established as a pulp mill in 1865. Nokia's main headquarters
            are in Espoo, Finland, in the Helsinki metropolitan area,[3] but the company's actual roots are in the
            Tampere region of Pirkanmaa.[6] In 2020, Nokia employed approximately 92,000 people[7] across over 100
            countries, did business in more than 130 countries, and reported annual revenues of around â‚¬23 billion.[4]
            Nokia is a public limited company listed on the Nasdaq Helsinki and New York Stock Exchange.[8] It was the
            world's 415th-largest company measured by 2016 revenues, according to the Fortune Global 500, having peaked
            at 85th place in 2009.[9] It is a component of the Euro Stoxx 50 stock market index.[10][11].The company has
            operated in various industries over the past 150 years. It was founded as a pulp mill and had long been
            associated with rubber and cables, but since the 1990s has focused on large-scale telecommunications
            infrastructure, technology development, and licensing.[12] Nokia made significant contributions to the
            mobile telephony industry, assisting in the development of the GSM, 3G, and LTE standards. For a decade
            beginning in 1998, Nokia was the largest worldwide vendor of mobile phones and smartphones. In the later
            2000s, however, Nokia suffered from a series of poor management decisions and soon saw its share of the
            mobile phone market drop sharply.</strong>
