    <p>🏁 What is Formula 1?
    Formula 1, also known as F1, is the highest class of international single-seater auto racing. It's governed by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA).

    🏎️ Key Features
    Cars: Extremely fast and technologically advanced. They can reach speeds over 350 km/h (217 mph).

    Teams: Major teams include Red Bull Racing, Ferrari, Mercedes-AMG, McLaren, and Aston Martin.

    Drivers: Stars like Max Verstappen, Lewis Hamilton, Charles Leclerc, and Fernando Alonso.

    🏆 How It Works
    The F1 season consists of a series of races known as Grands Prix (plural of Grand Prix), held around the world.

    Each race awards points to drivers and teams based on finishing positions.

    At the end of the season, two championships are awarded:

    Drivers’ Championship (best driver)

    Constructors’ Championship (best team)

    🔧 Cool Facts
    F1 engines rev up to 15,000 RPM.

    Teams spend hundreds of millions developing the cars.

    F1 cars have hybrid power units, combining a V6 engine with electric systems.
