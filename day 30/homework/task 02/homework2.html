        <h1 style="color: orange;">About</h1>
        <p style="color: yellow;">Built on the Volkswagen Group MLB Evo platform, the Urus shares many components with other Volkswagen Group luxury SUVs, such as the Audi Q7, Bentley Bentayga, Porsche Cayenne, and Volkswagen Touareg. With a top speed of 312 km/h (194 mph), the Urus SE is the fastest production SUV in the world. The model's nameplate derives from urus, the ancestor of modern domestic cattle, also known as the aurochs.[6] The Latin word urus was used for 'wild ox' from the Gallic Wars on.[7][8]</p>
