#Python’s eval() allows you to evaluate arbitrary Python expressions from a string-based or compiled-code-based input.
# This function can be handy when you’re trying to dynamically evaluate Python expressions from any input that comes as a string or a compiled code object.
# The join() method takes all items in an iterable and joins them into one string.
